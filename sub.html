    <p>  <big><big><big>  Not all sound is considered noise pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines noise above 65 decibels (dB) as noise pollution. To be precise, noise becomes harmful when it exceeds 75 decibels (dB) and is painful above 120 dB. As a consequence, it is recommended noise levels be kept below 65 dB during the day and indicates that restful sleep is impossible with nighttime ambient noise levels in excess of 30 dB.</big></big></big></p>

   <p><big><big><big> excess noise interferes with their ability to effectively echolocate.

    Some of the loudest underwater noise comes from naval sonar devices. Sonar, like echolocation, works by sending pulses of sound down into the depths of the ocean to bounce off an object and return an echo to the ship, which indicates a location for object. Sonar sounds can be as loud as 235 decibels and travel hundreds of miles under water, interfering with whales’ ability to use echolocation. Research has shown that sonar can cause mass strandings of whales on beaches and alter the feeding behavior of endangered blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus). Environmental groups are urging the U.S. Navy to stop or reduce using sonar for military training.
    
    Seismic surveys also produce loud blasts of sound within the ocean. Ships looking for deep-sea oil or gas deposits tow devices called air guns and shoot pulses of sound down to the ocean floor. The sound blasts can damage the ears of marine animals and cause serious injury. Scientists believe this noise may also be contributing to the altered behavior of whales.
    
    Among those researching the effects of noise pollution is Michel Andre, a bioacoustics researcher in Spain who is recording ocean sounds using instruments called hydrophones. His project, LIDO (Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment), collects data at 22 different locations. Back in the lab, computers identify the sounds of human activities as well as 26 species of whales and dolphins. The analysis aims to determine the effects that underwater noise is having on these animals. Andre hopes his project will find ways to protect marine animals from the dangers of ocean noise.</big></big></big></p>
    <h2><big><big><big><big>Causes of noise pollution</big></big></big></big></h2>
    <p><big><big><big>Environmental Noise: The kind of noise produced from the wide-range of environmental happenings refers to environmental noise. It can include thunderstorms, the mating calls of animals, and many more. 

        Man-made Noise: The sound created due to man-made activities refers to man-made noise and serves as the major reasons for noise pollution. It can include noise from vehicular traffic, construction work, household noise, and many more.Environmental pollution is one of the most dangerous threats to human health. Whether it’s about the traffic, people talking on phones for 1-2 hours, loud music, driving horns, and many more have become a part of the urban culture. The extensive sounds in the environment lead to noise pollution that can cause hypertension, sleeping disorders, and even health-related issues. In this handout, you will find out the major causes and effects of noise pollution on human health.</big></big></big></p>
        <p><big><big><big><br>What are the Causes of Noise Pollution?</br></p>
            <br>Industrialization: Most of the manufacturing companies and worldwide industries use big machines that can produce a large amount of noise. Apart from that, different equipment such as exhaust fans, compressors, grinding mills, and many more participate in producing big sound. The wide-ranging exposure to high levels of sound can damage the hearing abilities of the workers.</br></p>
            
           <br> Transportation: Traffic serves as one of the major causes of sound pollution as numerous vehicles at the same time on the roads produce heavy noise. Apart from it, underground trains, airplanes flying over houses, and other transportation modes make it difficult for people to get adapted to high sound.</br>
            
            <br>Construction Activities: The construction of buildings, stations, roads, dams, flyovers, and mining produces high noise. The sound produced can even hinder the hearing capacities of an individual exposed to the sound.</br>
            
            Social Events: Whether it’s a club, worship place, marriage, or any other social place, people usually create a nuisance that becomes the major cause of noise pollution. Playing songs on full volume can affect the hearing abilities of an individual who is frequently exposed to such sounds.</big></big></big></p>
