<h1 align="center"><font color="orange" face="impact" size="5">Noise pollution is an invisible danger</font></h1> <h2><font color="white"><p>It cannot be seen, but it is present nonetheless, both on land and under the sea. Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and well-being of humans and other organisms.
Sound is measured in decibels. </p>Increasing noise is not only affecting animals on land, it is also a growing problem for those that live in the ocean. Ships, oil drills, sonar devices, and seismic tests have made the once tranquil marine environment loud and chaotic. Whales and dolphins are particularly impacted by noise pollution.<p>
<hr><hr><marquee width="90%" scrollamount="19" bgcolor="blue"><font size="6" color="white">There are many sounds in the environment, from rustling leaves (20 to 30 decibels) to a thunderclap (120 decibels) to the wail of a siren (120 to 140 decibels).Sounds that reach 85 decibels or higher can harm a person’s ears. Sound sources that exceed this threshold include familiar things, such as power lawn mowers (90 decibels), subway trains (90 to 115 decibels), and loud rock concerts (110 to 120 decibels).</font></marquee><hr><hr>
These marine mammals rely on <font color="violet">echolocation to communicate</font>, navigate, feed, and find mates, and excess noise interferes with their ability to effectively echolocate.</p>
Noise pollution impacts millions of people on a daily basis. The most common health problem it causes is <font color="gray">Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL)</font>. Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health problems can affect all age groups, especially children. Many children who live near noisy airports or streets have been found to suffer from stress and other problems, such as impairments in memory, attention level, and reading skill.<p>Some of the loudest underwater noise comes from naval sonar devices. Sonar, like echolocation, works by sending pulses of sound down into the depths of the ocean to bounce off an object and return an echo to the ship, which indicates a location for object. </p>Sonar sounds can be as loud as 235 decibels and travel hundreds of miles under water, interfering with whales’ ability to use echolocation. Research has shown that sonar can cause mass strandings of whales on beaches and alter the feeding behavior of <font color="red">endangered blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus)</font>. Environmental groups are urging the U.S. Navy to stop or reduce using sonar for military training.</font></h2>

<h2><font color="white">Traffic blaring on the ground, planes roaring through the sky, ships bellowing through the oceans—where humans go, they often make a lot of noise. Excess noise is known to have adverse health effects for humans, and according to a wide-ranging study published in Biology Letters, man-made noise should be considered a <font color="purple">“major global pollutant”</font> for animals, too.<p><hr><hr><marquee bgcolor="red" width="90%" scrollamount="19"><font color="white" face="algerian" size="6">The analysis covered 108 studies of 109 species, which were divided into seven groups: amphibians, anthropods, birds, mammals, fish, reptiles and molluscs.Both terrestrial and aquatic animals were included in the analysis.</marquee><hr><hr></p> According to the <font color="orange">Guardian’s Nicola Davis</font>, the researchers looked at studies that measured changes in species’ behavior or other traits, like hormone levels, both before and after exposure to noise. “The size of any shift from pre-noise behaviour was then calculated on a scale,” Davis explains. “The latest research took all of these calculations and put them together.”<p>In the hatching season the birds are able to disturbed becuase of noise pollution. All seven groups were impacted by <font color="violet">anthropogenic</font> noise, the researchers found, as were a wide range of species—from tiny insects to large marine mammalsYet the researchers stress that noise pollution poses threats that could impact the survival of many species. Amphibians, birds, insects and mammals all rely on sound to convey essential information, like mating and warning signals. Fish larvae find their homes by following the sounds of coral reefs.<p>Owls, like bats, use acoustic signals to locate prey. All of these fundamental behaviors are at risk if animals can’t hear properly over booming anthropogenic noise.</font></h2>

<h1><font size="5" color="yellow" face="bodoni mt condens"><center><u><i> Eliminate Noise During Design</i></U></center></font></h1>
One of the best ways to reduce noise exposure is to consider noise in the project design phase. This can be done by choosing equipment that reduces the noise level and by eliminating design flaws that can amplify noise.<br>
<center><font color="white">Here are a few ways that you can optimize your work site to reduce noise before starting construction:</font></center>
<ul type="disc"><li><font color="purple">Covering metal tables</font></li> <li>metal wheels and other metal pieces with rubber to reduce noise vibration
Modifying parts to reduce rattle and ringing</li>
<li><font color="violet">Lining tumbling barrels</font></li> <li>metal chutes and hoppers with an elastic material such as cork</li> <li><font color="brown">hard rubber to reduce mechanical shock between parts</font></li>
<li>Reducing noise resulting from vibration of beams</li> <li><font color="pink">plates by ensuring machine rotational speeds do not coincide with resonance frequencies of the supporting structure</font></li></ul><p>
<h1> <center><font size="5" color="yellow" face="bodoni mt condens"><u><i>Add Noise Barriers</i></u></font></center></h1>
<font color="blue">Noise barriers block the direct path of sound waves from the source of noise</font>, protecting workers and the community from noise exposure. They do not eliminate noise, but they help to reduce the level of noise.</p>
Noise barriers work by enclosing the source of sound within <font color="gray">sound-absorbing</font> materials like mineral wool. A few examples of machinery you may want to add noise barriers to include saws and jackhammers.<p>
<h1><center><font size="5" color="yellow" face="bodoni mt condens"><u> <i>Use Sound-Absorbing Materials</i></u></font></center></h1>
Sound-absorbing materials can be helpful in reducing construction noise. Materials such as metal, wood and concrete are <font color="orange">sound-reflective materials</font> that sound waves bounce off of. Instead, opt for materials such as carpet, foam padding or <font color="white">fiberglass insulation</font> that absorb sound. Place these types of materials on floors, ceilings and walls to help reduce sound reverberation.</p>
<h1><center><font size="5" color="yellow" face="bodoni mt condens"><u><i> Choose Less Noisy Equipment</i></u></font></center></h1>
There’s no getting around the fact that construction equipment can be loud, but there are ways to choose equipment that is quieter.

A general rule of thumb is that<font color="dark red"> electronic-powered equipment is quieter than diesel-powered equipment.</font> Similarly,<font color="white"> hydraulically powered equipment is quieter than pneumatic power.</font> It’s important to note that quieter machines or processes can cost more because manufacturing tolerances on the machines are tighter, gears mesh better, quieter cooling fans are used.</font></h2>
