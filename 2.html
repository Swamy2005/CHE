   <p><br>Noise pollution is an invisible danger that affects the health and well-being of all life. In this series of blogs, we will be looking at noise pollution and how it affects wildlife, people, and the environment.</br>

    
    The World Health Organisation has stated that noise is one of the most hazardous forms of pollution. Studies have shown that loud noise can cause caterpillars’ hearts to beat faster and bluebirds to have fewer chicks. Noise pollution makes it difficult for animals to use sound for navigation, finding food, mating, and avoiding predators, affecting many animals’ ability to survive.

    A paper published by Queen’s University Belfast titled ‘Biology Letters’ sheds light on the damage that noise pollution or human-made noise can have on wildlife.
    
    In this study, over one hundred species were analysed and divided into seven groups: amphibians, arthropods, birds, fish, mammals, molluscs, and reptiles. The study was based on experiments in which different aspects of the animals’ behaviour were recorded before and after exposure to noise.
    
    The results found evidence that noise pollution impacts all seven groups of species, and the different groups didn’t differ in their response to noise.
    
    Dr Kunc from Queen’s University Belfast said, “We always talk about climate change, chemical pollution, plastic pollution and habitat destruction…but noise, especially in urban areas, can really have a negative impact on animals.”
    
    Solutions to reduce noise pollution
    
    It’s important to raise awareness of noise pollution, the causes, and its impact, to begin to make changes.
    
    Simple lifestyle changes, such as avoiding noisy leisure activities, opting for alternative, quieter means of transport, insulating your home with noise-absorbing materials etc., are key to beginning the journey to reducing noise pollution.
    
    Governments also play an essential role in ensuring correct noise management is being used. For example, protecting certain areas from noise, establishing regulations, installing noise insulation in new buildings etc.
    
    We all have a role to play in beating the invisible enemy that is noise pollution, and we must stay vigilant to ensure that we protect our wildlife from further harm.

    <p>Noise pollution can potentially impact wildlife at the individual, population, species and community levels. These impacts occur in both urban and rural environments and, in some situations, could be a significant contributor to local and regional extinctions of small or geographically-confined populations. The overall impacts of anthropogenic (human-generated) noise are likely to increase significantly over at least the next few decades as urban areas expand into new areas, the human population increases in distribution and abundance, and human activities become more intensive and widespread. Therefore, there is an urgent need for ecological impact assessments to pay greater attention to noise impacts on wildlife, and to develop and implement more effective measures of avoiding or minimising them. There also needs to be scientifically-valid assessments of the effectiveness of these measures for each development or activity. This can be achieved through appropriate legislation and government regulation. Unfortunately, we seem to be moving in the opposite direction (i.e. less vigilant about disturbances, such as noise pollution, on the natural environment) because our environmental legislation, regulations and processes are becoming increasingly more bureaucratic (and less meaningful) and focused on habitat drivers of biodiversity protection (e.g. habitat protection and management, and biodiversity offsetting). While these drivers are important, they should not be pursued by ignoring or giving only momentary thought to other significant impacts</p>
    <p>The present article identifies the main sources of anthropogenic noise, known impacts on wildlife at the individual, population and community levels, and discusses measures for avoiding or mitigating these impacts.</p>

</body>    <p>Ground-breaking research published in the scientific journal, Nature, in December 2020 showed that anthropogenic (human-made) noise, artificial night light and climate change have combined, as well as individual, impacts on the breeding success of North American birds.</p>
<p>The researchers examined records collected from 58,506 nests of 142 species in North America’s NestWatch Program, unlike previous studies which have focused on individual species or populations. They correlated the bird data with the light data gathered by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite.  Anthropogenic noise data were from recent country-wide geospatial models that estimate acoustic conditions at a resolution of 270 metres. </p>

<p>Birds time their reproduction to coincide with peak food availability to feed their young, using daylight cues to breed about the same time each year. Light pollution causes birds to begin nesting up to one month earlier than normal in open environments such as grasslands or wetlands and 18 days earlier in forested environments. Previous studies have shown that global warming has resulted in birds’ food supplies (e.g. insects, seeds, fruit and nectar) peaking in abundance earlier (late winter/early spring), which coincides with migratory bird species arriving at their breeding grounds earlier, and advancing or postponing autumn migration at the conclusion of breeding. Both resident and migratory species are also laying their first egg earlier in response to global warming. The North American study showed species that are more responsive to light pollution (i.e. those species in open habitats), and hence able to advance the timing of their breeding, have better reproductive success because they are able to better synchronise with the peak availability of food resources. In contrast, forested birds, which are less responsive to light pollution, rely more on natural changes in daylength to reach breeding condition and elicit breeding behaviour. Therefore, they may be less able to adapt to breeding in response to the earlier availability of food resources.</p>

  
<p>Birds living in forested environments tend to be more sensitive to anthropogenic noise than birds in open environments. While amplitude, duration and temporal patterns of sound are important, noise pollution delays nesting for birds whose songs are at a lower frequency and thus more difficult to hear through low-frequency anthrogenic noise. Mating decisions are based on the male's song, and in some cases, females need to hear the male's song to become physically ready to breed. Therefore, anthropogenic noise has the potential to dampen the ability of bird species to breed earlier in response to earlier food availability, this impact being greatest for forest bird species that have pair-bonding and territorial songs in the lower sound frequency range.</p>
